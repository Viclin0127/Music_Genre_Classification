Sections of my implementation are as below:
1. Read csv data files which include train, validate and test dataset
2. Transfer labels from categorical to numerical for easy computation

As report mentioned, we split features into tags features, metadata features and audio features.

3. Dealing with tags features: 
    We try to get every single tag in tags features and use Bag of words method to transfer tags features into numeric value (how 
    many times this word appear in this instance)
4. Train and evaluate different models
5. Dealing with metadata features:
    We try to compare each model based on different conditions (features selection, cross validation
6. Train and evaluate different models
7. Dealing with audio features:
    We try to compare each model based on different K-folds CV and weither normalized or not
8. Train and evaluate different models

9. Testing
    In testing, we will combine three better methods using two majority voting approaches to do our testing on validation dataset.
10. Confusion matrices based on two different majority voting approaches
11. Final result and output for kaggle competition
